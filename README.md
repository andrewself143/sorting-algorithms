# sorting-algorithms

A project where I analyzed a variety of sorting algorithms on different types of data. Check out the report [here](sortingexperiments.pdf).

<br>Here is a gif demonstrating shell sort. You can see my implementation of shell sort in [algorithm-implementations/shell_sort1.cpp](algorithm-implementations/shell_sort1.cpp).<br>
